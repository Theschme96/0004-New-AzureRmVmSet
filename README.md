# 0004-New-AzureRmVmSet
This script creates a set of 1-4 Windows Server 2016 VMs with Network Security Groups for RDP access. In this script, these machines will be deployed using the ABC[DC]## convention, where ABC is the 3 letter airport code of the location, DC indicates that these machines can subsequently be configured as domain controllers, and ## represents the sequence numbers, i.e. 01, 02, etc.Â Azure resources will be created as part of an initial process of building a functional environment consisting of compute, storage and netorking components. Since this script will be used primarily for demonstration purposes, additional comments, logging and verbose console output have also been included.
